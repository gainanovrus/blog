I am continuing write articles about DELL Networking System (OS9 series). This short note will show how to disable SupportAssist, enabled by default installation.

## About SupportAssist

SupportAssist sends troubleshooting data securely to Dell. SupportAssist does not support automated email notification at the time of hardware fault alert, automatic case creation, automatic part dispatch, or reports. SupportAssist requires Dell EMC Networking OS9.

## About problem

Every time I log in to my Dell switch I see this:
```
 The SupportAssist EULA acceptance option has not been selected. SupportAssist
 can be enabled once the SupportAssist EULA has been accepted. Use the:
 'support-assist activate' command to accept EULA and enable SupportAssist.
```

So I wand to disable this. I would try running this command (in `CONF` mode):
```
Dell# conf
Dell(conf)# eula-consent support-assist reject
```

The result will be:
```
I do not accept the terms of the license agreement. The SupportAssist feature has
been deactivated and can no longer be used.
To enable SupportAssist configurations, accept the terms of the license agreement
by configuring this command 'eula-consent support-assist accept'.
```

## Check the status

If you enter the command `show eula-consent support-assist` you will see a status (`Rejected`) of this feature:

```
Dell# show eula-consent support-assist

SupportAssist EULA has been: Rejected

Additional information about the SupportAssist EULA is as follows:

(e.g. name, phone number and/or email address) which would be used to provide
technical support for your Dell EMC products and services.  Dell EMC may use the information

Dell EMC SupportAssist also collects and stores machine diagnostic information, which
may include but is not limited to configuration information, user supplied contact
information, names of data volumes, IP addresses, access control lists, diagnostics &

& performance information and related data ("Collected Data") and transmits this
information to Dell EMC. By downloading SupportAssist and agreeing to be bound by these
terms and the Dell EMC end user license agreement, available at: https://i.dell.com

## Conclusion

This short post that could be packed in one command.
But I want to point an importance of security.
Any communication with external system might be used as a back-door attacker.
The SupportAssist has have a vulnerability in the past. Read the [post](https://xakep.ru/2019/06/24/supportassist/) about it.
